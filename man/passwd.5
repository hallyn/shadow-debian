be found in \fI/etc/shadow\fR.

a thru z, A thru Z, 0 thru 9, \. and /.
Refer to \fBcrypt\fR(3) for details on how this string is
interpreted.

.\" An optional password age string may follow the encrypted
.\" password, separated by a comma, from the same alphabet
.\" as the password itself.
.\" The first character gives the number of weeks during which the
.\" password is valid.
.\" The second character gives the number of weeks which must pass
.\" before the user is permitted to change the password.
.\" The last two characters give the week since Jan 1970 when the
.\" password was last changed.
.\" When the number of weeks during which the password is valid
.\" have passed, the user will be required to provide a new
.\" password.

\fBfinger\fR(1).
Three additional values may be present in the comment field.
They are

command language interpreter, or the name of the initial program
