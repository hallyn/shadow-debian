.SH NAME
chsh \- change login shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP 5
\fBchsh\fR
[\fB-s \fIlogin_shell\fR] [\fIuser\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBchsh\fR changes the user login shell.
This determines the name of the user's initial login command.
A normal user may only change the login shell for her own account,
the super user may change the login shell for any account.
.PP
The only restrictions placed on the login shell is that the
command name must be listed in \fI/etc/shells\fR, unless the
invoker is the super-user, and then any value may be added.
An account with a restricted login shell may not change
her login shell.
For this reason, placing \fB/bin/rsh\fR in \fI/etc/shells\fR
is discouraged since accidentally changing to a restricted
shell would prevent the user from every changing her login
shell back to its original value.
.PP
If the \fB-s\fR option is not selected, \fBchsh\fR operates in an interactive
fashion, prompting the user with the current login shell.
Enter the new value to change the shell, or leave the line blank to use
the current one.
The current shell is displayed between a pair of \fB[ ]\fR marks.
