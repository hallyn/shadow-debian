This is my wishlist for the shadow suite, in no particular order.  Feel
free to do anything from this list and mail me the diffs :-).

Patches in diff -u format, against the latest version (sometimes in the
"beta" directory) are preferred and make my job easier.  Please, no
MIME, base64, quoted-printable, or HTML.  For very big patches, or if
your mailer can corrupt them, please use gzip and uuencode.  Thanks!

New ideas to add to this list are welcome, too.  --marekm

- fix all the bugs, of course
- implement "su only" accounts (no logins, only su from other account)
- rewrite getdef.c to be more general? (no hardcoded names)
- update man pages to reflect all the changes (real programmers ... :-)
- patch for rlogind/telnetd to create utmp entry and fill in ut_addr
- fix the usermod -l bug properly [for now it's OK - #undef AUTH_METHODS]
- option to specify encrypted password in passwd (for yppasswdd, so it
  doesn't need to know about shadow/non-shadow); should probably use a pipe
  (less insecure than command line arguments)
- add support for changing NIS passwords
- clean up NDBM support, do it in the library and not in all programs
- add option to check passwords by piping them to external programs
- add functionality of the contrib/rpasswd.c wrapper to passwd
- option to generate pronounceable passwords (like on SCO), external program?
- poppassd (remote password change for eudora etc.)
- add support for passwd/shadow db files (glibc)
- better documentation
- su -l, -m, -p, -s options (as in GNU su) - done in the Debian patches
- vipw: check password files for errors after editing
- clean up login utmp(x) handling code
- add "maximum time users allowed to stay logged in" limit option to logoutd
- handle quotes in /etc/environment like the shell does (but sshd doesn't...)
- write man pages: dialups.5, d_passwd.5
- better utmpx support (logoutd, ...)
- better OPIE support (report number of logins left, etc.)
- new option for /etc/suauth: don't load user's environment (force "su -")
  suggested by Ulisses Alonso Camaro
- clean up error messages - "program_name: text of error message\n"
  (maybe some common code for common messages about failing to lock/open
  something)
- find out why recent releases won't compile on Solaris
- newusers UID/GID selection algorithm should be the same as useradd
  (and use UID_MIN, UID_MAX from login.defs)
- newusers should be able to copy /etc/skel to the new home directory
  (like useradd)
- integrate the changes from Debian (complete PAM support, bug fixes)
- add directories where other packages can add hooks for package-specific
  per-user configuration, to be executed with run-parts. Some hooks should
  be executed at package install time for existing users, likewise for
  package removal and possibly modification.  (Debian Bug#36019)
