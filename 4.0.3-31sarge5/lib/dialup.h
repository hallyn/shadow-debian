 * Structure of the /etc/d_passwd file
 *
 *	The d_passwd file contains the names of login shells which require
 *	dialup passwords.  Each line contains the fully qualified path name
 *	for the shell, followed by an optional password.  Each field is
 *	separated by a ':'.
 *
 * Structure of the /etc/dialups file
 *
 *	The dialups file contains the names of ports which may be dialup
 *	lines.  Each line consists of the last component of the path
 *	name.  The leading "/dev/" string is removed.
