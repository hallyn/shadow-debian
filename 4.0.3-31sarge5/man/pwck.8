.SH NAME
pwck \- verify integrity of password files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpwck\fR [\fB-sr\fR] [\fIpasswd\fR \fIshadow\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpwck\fR verifies the integrity of the system authentication information.
All entries in the \fI/etc/passwd\fR and \fI/etc/shadow\fR are checked to
see that the entry has the proper format and valid data in each field.
The user is prompted to delete entries that are improperly formatted or
which have other uncorrectable errors.
.P
Checks are made to verify that each entry has
.sp
.in +.5i
- the correct number of fields
.br
- a unique user name
.br
- a valid user and group identifier
.br
- a valid primary group
.br
- a valid home directory
.br
- a valid login shell
.in -.5i
.sp
.P
The checks for correct number of fields and unique user name are fatal.
If the entry has the wrong number of fields, the user will be prompted to
delete the entire line.
If the user does not answer affirmatively, all further checks are bypassed.
An entry with a duplicated user name is prompted for deletion, but the
remaining checks will still be made.
All other errors are warning and the user is encouraged to run the
\fBusermod\fR command to correct the error.
.P
The commands which operate on the \fI/etc/passwd\fR file are not able to
alter corrupted or duplicated entries.
\fBpwck\fR should be used in those circumstances to remove the offending
entry.
.SH OPTIONS
By default, \fBpwck\fR operates on the files \fI/etc/passwd\fR and
\fI/etc/shadow\fR.
The user may select alternate files with the \fIpasswd\fR and \fIshadow\fR
parameters.
Additionally, the user may execute the command in read-only mode by
specifying the \fB-r\fR flag.
This causes all questions regarding changes to be answered \fBno\fR
without user intervention.
\fBpwck\fR can also sort entries in \fI/etc/passwd\fR and \fI/etc/shadow\fR
by UID. To run it in sort mode pass it \fB-s\fR flag. No checks are
performed then, it just sorts.
.SH FILES
/etc/passwd \- user account information
.br
/etc/shadow \- encrypted password information
.br
/etc/group \- group information
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR group (5),
.BR passwd (5),
.BR shadow (5),
.BR usermod (8)
