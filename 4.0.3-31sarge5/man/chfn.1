.SH NAME
chfn \- change real user name and information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP 5
\fBchfn\fR
[\fB-f \fIfull_name\fR] [\fB-r \fIroom_no\fR]
.br
[\fB-w \fIwork_ph\fR] [\fB-h \fIhome_ph\fR] [\fB-o \fIother\fR]
[\fIuser\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBchfn\fR changes user fullname, office number, office extension, and home
phone number information for a user's account.
This information is typically printed by \fBfinger\fR(1) and similar
programs.
A normal user may only change the fields for her own account,
subject to the restrictions in /etc/login.defs.  (The default configuration
is to prevent users from changing their fullname.)
The super user may change any field for any account.
Additionally, only the super user may use the \fB-o\fR option to change the
undefined portions of the GECOS field.
.PP
The only restriction placed on the contents of the fields is that no
control characters may be present, nor any of comma, colon, or equal sign.
.\" The \fIother\fR field does not have this restriction, and is used to
.\" store accounting information used by other applications.
.PP
If none of the options are selected, \fBchfn\fR operates in an interactive
fashion, prompting the user with the current values for all of the fields.
Enter the new value to change the field, or leave the line blank to use
the current value.
The current value is displayed between a pair of \fB[ ]\fR marks.
Without options, chfn prompts for the current user account.
