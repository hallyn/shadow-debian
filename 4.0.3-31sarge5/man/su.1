.TH SU 1
.SH NAME
su \- Change user ID or become super-user
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsu\fP [\fBOPTS\fR] [\fB-\fP] [\fBusername\fP [\fBARGS\fP]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B su
is used to become another user during a login session.
Invoked without a username, \fBsu\fR defaults to becoming
the super user.
The optional argument \fB\-\fR may be used to provide an
environment similiar to what the user would expect had
the user logged in directly.
.PP
The user will be prompted for a password, if appropriate.  Invalid
passwords will produce an error message.  All attempts, both valid and
invalid, are logged to detect abuses of the system.
.PP
An optional command can be executed. This is done by the shell specified
in \fI/etc/passwd\fR for the target user unless the \fB-s\fR or \fB-m\fR
options are used.  Any arguments supplied after the \fBusername\fR will be
passed to the invoked shell (shell must support the -c command line
option in order for a command to be passed to it).
.PP
Unless the \fB-m\fR or \fB-p\fR options are used, the current environment is
passed to the new shell with alterations.  The value of \fB$PATH\fR is
reset to \fB/bin:/usr/bin\fR for normal users, or
\fB/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin\fR for the super user.  This may be
changed with the \fBENV_PATH\fR and \fBENV_SUPATH\fR definitions in
\fI/etc/login.defs\fR. 
\fB$IFS\fP, if is set, is reset to contain space, tab, and newline.
\fB$USER\fP is set to the name of the target user, 
\fB$HOME\fP is set to the home directory of the target user, and
\fB$SHELL\fP is set to the shell of the target user.
When using the \fB-m\fR or \fB-p\fR options, the
user's environment is not changed.
.PP
A subsystem login is indicated by the presense of a "*" as the first
character of the login shell. The given home directory will be used as
the root of a new filesystem which the user is actually logged into.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB-\fR
make this a login shell
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-commmand\fR=\fI<command>\fR
pass \fIcommand\fR to the invoked shell using its \fB-c\fR option
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-preserve\-environment\fR
do not reset environment variables, and keep the same shell
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-shell\fR=\fI<shell>\fR
use \fIshell\fR instead of the default in /etc/passwd
.PP
.SH NOTES
The \fB-m\fR, \fB-p\fR and \fB-s\fR options are restricted by the target
user's shell being listed in \fB/etc/shells\fR. If it's not listed, then
it's assumed to be a restricted account, a normal su is performed, and
those options are ignored silently.
.PP
A subsystem login is indicated by the presense of a "*" as the first
character of the login shell. The given home directory will be used as
the root of a new filesystem which the user is actually logged into.
.PP
Much of the behavior of this command can be altered via its pam
configuration \- see
.BR pam (7)
.SH CAVEATS

may be in use at any particular site.
