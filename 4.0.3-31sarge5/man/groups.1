.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgroups\fR [\fIuser\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgroups\fR displays the current group names or ID values. If the value
does not have a corresponding entry in \fI/etc/group\fR, the value will be
displayed as the numerical group value. The optional \fIuser\fR parameter
will display the groups for the named \fIuser\fR.
.SH NOTE
Systems which do not support concurrent group sets will have the information
from \fI/etc/group\fR reported.
The user must use \fBnewgrp\fR or \fBsg\fR to change their current real and
effective group ID.
