.SH NAME
\fBchpasswd\fR - update password file in batch
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBchpasswd\fR [\fB--encrypted\fR] [\fB--md5\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBchpasswd\fR reads a file of user name and password pairs
from standard input and uses this information
to update a group of existing users. Without the --encrypted switch, the
passwords are expected to be cleartext. With the --encrypted switch, the
passwords are expected to be in encrypted form.
Each line is of the format
.sp 1
	  \fIuser_name\fR:\fIpassword\fR
.sp 1
The named user must exist.
The supplied password will be encrypted as necessary, and the password age
updated, if present.
.PP
This command is intended to be used in a large system environment where
many accounts are created at a single time.
.PP
The --md5 switch allows using MD5 encryption instead of the default DES
encryption when the supplied passwords are not already in encrypted form.
.SH CAVEATS
.\" The \fBmkpasswd\fR command must be executed afterwards to update the
.\" DBM password files.
The input file must be protected if it contains unencrypted passwords.
.\" This command may be discarded in favor of the newusers(8) command.
