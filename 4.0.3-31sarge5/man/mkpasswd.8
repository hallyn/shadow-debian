.SH NAME
mkpasswd \- Update passwd and group database files
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmkpasswd\fR [\fB-fvgps\fR] \fIfile\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mkpasswd
reads the file in the format given by the flags and converts it to the
corresponding database file format.
These database files are used to improve access performance on systems
with large numbers of users.
The output files will be named \fIfile\fR.dir and \fIfile\fR.pag.
.PP
The \fB-f\fR option causes \fBmkpasswd\fR to ignore any existing output
files and overwrite them.
Normally \fBmkpasswd\fR complains about existing output files and quits.
.PP
The \fB-v\fR option causes \fBmkpasswd\fR to output information about
each record as it is converted, with a final message at the very end.
.PP
The \fB-g\fR option treats the input file as though it were in
\fI/etc/group\fR file format.
When combined with the \fB-s\fR option, the \fI/etc/gshadow\fR file
format is used instead.
.PP
The \fB-p\fR option treats the input file as though it were in
\fI/etc/passwd\fR file format.
This is the default.
When combined with the \fB-s\fR option, the \fI/etc/shadow\fR file
format is used instead.
.SH CAVEATS
The use of more than one database file is limited to systems which
include the NDBM database library and therefore may not be available
on every system.
.SH NOTE
Since most commands are capable of updating the database files as
changes are made, this command need only be used when re-creating a
deleted or corrupted database file.
