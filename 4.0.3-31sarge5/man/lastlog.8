.TH LASTLOG 8
.SH NAME
lastlog \- examine lastlog file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP 8
\fBlastlog\fR [<\fB-u\fR|\fB--user\fR> \fIlogin-name\fR]
[<\fB-t\fR|\fB--time\fR> \fIdays\fR] [<\fB-h\fR|\fB--help\fR>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBlastlog\fR formats and prints the contents of the last login log
\fI/var/log/lastlog\fR file. The \fBlogin-name\fR, \fBport\fR, and \fBlast
login time\fR will be printed. The default (no flags) causes lastlog entries
to be printed, sorted by their order in /etc/passwd.
.TP
\fB-u\fR, \fB--user\fR \fIlogin-name\fR
will cause the lastlog record for
\fIlogin-name\fR only to be printed
.TP
\fB-t\fR, \fB--time\fR \fIdays\fR
will cause only the lastlogins more recent
than fIdays\fR to be printed
.TP
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
print a one-line help message and exit.
.PP
The \fB-t\fR flag overrides the use of \fB-u\fR.
.PP
If the user has never logged in the message \fB"**Never logged in**"\fR will
be displayed instead of the port and time.
.SH FILES
/var/log/lastlog \- lastlog logging file
.SH CAVEATS
Large gaps in uid numbers will cause the lastlog program to run longer with
no output to the screen (i.e. if mmdf=800 and last uid=170, program will
appear to hang as it processes uid 171-799).
