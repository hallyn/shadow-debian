shadow (4.0.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  CLOSE_SESSIONS and other variables are not used anymore in
  /etc/login/defs.
  As shadow utilities which use this file now warn about unknown
  entries there, administrators should remove such unknown entries.
  The supplied login.defs file does not include them anymore.

  dpasswd is no more distributed by upstream. Login do not support
  dialup password anymore.  Re-introducing this functionality in
  upstream is not trivial.
