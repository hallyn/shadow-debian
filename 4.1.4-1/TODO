Things that should be done:
 * the patches directory can be cleaned
   + It would be nice to have the program and man page correction in the
     same patch
 * other queries on debian-devel:
   + should PAM session be closed as root?
 * Verify the files left in debian/tmp
   + e.g. /etc/default/adduser should be installed
 * Check the build system: rebuilding the package twoce in the same tree
   doubles the size of the diff.gz file

Other points (not related to the release of a syncronized shadow):
 * compare the source with the usages and man pages
   + probably add a sentence to chsh/chfn's manpages about authentication
     required for ordinary users
 * do something (a tool) for the variables in login.defs
   In Debian, some tools are not compiled with the PAM support, so upstream
   getdef.c won't be OK.
   It should be nice to see in each man page the set of variables used.
   The Debian package can now compile (export DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS='nostrip debug')
   with the debugging informations. This may be used to extract the set of
   variables used in Debian/for each tools.
 * verify all the patches around (I've found patches for at least RedHat,
   OWL, LFS, Mandriva, Gentoo; are they already applied?)
 * make a testsuite
   + all options could be tested
   + by reading the man page and writing some small tests for each
     functionnality (and testing the limit cases, we can probably find
     a lot of small/documentation bugs)
     e.g. test chage with some fields set to 0
          test chage with a date argument instead of a number of days
