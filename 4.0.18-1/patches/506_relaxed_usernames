Goal: Relaxed usernames/groupnames checking patch.

Status wrt upstream: Debian specific. Not to be used upstream

Details:
 Allows any non-empty user/grounames that don't contain ':' and '\n'
 characters and don't start with '-'. This patch is more restrictive
 than original Karl's version. closes: #264879
 Also closes: #377844
 
 Comments from Karl Ramm (shadow 1:4.0.3-9, 20 Aug 2003 02:06:50 -0400):
 
 I can't come up with a good justification as to why characters other
 than ':'s and '\0's should be disallowed in group and usernames (other
 than '-' as the leading character).  Thus, the maintenance tools don't
 anymore.  closes: #79682, #166798, #171179
