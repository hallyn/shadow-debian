Template: passwd/root-password
Type: password
_Description: Root password:
 You need to set a password for 'root', the system administrative
 account. A malicious or unqualified user with root access can have
 disastrous results, so you should take care to choose a root password
 that is not easy to guess. It should not be a word found in dictionaries,
 or a word that could be easily associated with you.
 .
 A good password will contain a mixture of letters, numbers and punctuation
 and should be changed at regular intervals.
 .
 Note that you will not be able to see the password as you type it.

Template: passwd/root-password-again
Type: password
_Description: Re-enter password to verify:
 Please enter the same root password again to verify that you have typed it
 correctly.

Template: passwd/make-user
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Create a normal user account now?
 It's a bad idea to use the root account for normal day-to-day activities,
 such as the reading of electronic mail, because even a small mistake can
 result in disaster. You should create a normal user account to use for
 those day-to-day tasks.
 .
 Note that you may create it later (as well as any additional account) by
 typing 'adduser <username>' as root, where <username> is an user name,
 like 'imurdock' or 'rms'.

Template: passwd/user-fullname
Type: string
_Description: Full name for the new user:
 A user account will be created for you to use instead of the root
 account for non-administrative activities.
 .
 Please enter the real name of this user. This information will be used
 for instance as default origin for emails sent by this user as well as
 any program which displays or uses the user's real name. Your full
 name is a reasonable choice.

Template: passwd/username
Type: string
_Description: Username for your account:
 Select a username for the new account. Your first name is a reasonable choice.
 The username should start with a lower-case letter, which can be
 followed by any combination of numbers and more lower-case letters.

Template: passwd/username-bad
Type: note
_Description: Invalid username
 The user name you entered is invalid. Note that usernames must start with
 a lower-case letter, which can be followed by any combination of numbers
 and more lower-case letters.

Template: passwd/user-password
Type: password
_Description: Password for the new user:

Template: passwd/user-password-again
Type: password
_Description: Re-enter password to verify:

 correctly.

Template: passwd/password-mismatch
Type: note
_Description: Password input error

Template: passwd/password-empty
Type: note
_Description: Empty password

 Please choose a non-empty password.

Template: passwd/shadow
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Enable shadow passwords?
 Shadow passwords make your system more secure because nobody is able to
 view even encrypted passwords. The passwords are stored in a separate file
 that can only be read by special programs. The use of shadow passwords
 is strongly recommended, except in a few cases such as NIS environments.
