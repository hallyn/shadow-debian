.TH NEWGRP 1
.SH NAME
newgrp \- log in to a new group
.br
sg \- execute command as different group ID
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBnewgrp\fR [\fB-\fR] [\fIgroup\fR]
.br
\fBsg\fR [\fB-\fR] [\fIgroup\fR [[\fB-c\fR] \fIcommand\fR]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBnewgrp\fR is used to change the current group ID during a login session.
If the optional \fB\-\fR flag is given, the user's environment
will be reinitialized as though the user had logged in, otherwise
the current environment, including current working directory,
remains unchanged.
.PP
\fBnewgrp\fR changes the current real group ID to the named group, or to the
default group listed in \fI/etc/passwd\fR if no group name is given. The
user will be prompted for a password if she do not have a password and the
group does, or if the user is not listed as a member and the group has a
password. The user will be denied access if the group password is empty and
the user is not listed as a member.
.PP
The \fBsg\fR command works similar to \fBnewgrp\fR but accepts a command.
The command will be executed with the Bourne shell.  With most shells you
may run \fBsg\fR from, you need to enclose multi-word commands in quotes.
Another difference between \fBnewgrp\fR and \fBsg\fR is that some shells
treat \fBnewgrp\fR specially, replacing themselves with a new instance of
a shell that \fBnewgrp\fR creates.  This doesn't happen with \fBsg\fR, so
upon exit from a \fBsg\fR command you are returned to your previous group ID.
