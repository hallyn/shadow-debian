#
#    Translators, if you are not familiar with the PO format, gettext
#    documentation is worth reading, especially sections dedicated to
#    this format, e.g. by running:
#         info -n '(gettext)PO Files'
#         info -n '(gettext)Header Entry'
#
#    Some information specific to po-debconf are available at
#            /usr/share/doc/po-debconf/README-trans
#         or http://www.debian.org/intl/l10n/po-debconf/README-trans
#
#    Developers do not need to manually edit POT or PO files.

"You need to set a password for 'root', the system administrative account. A "
"malicious or unqualified user with root access can have disastrous results, "
"so you should take care to choose a root password that is not easy to guess. "
"It should not be a word found in the dictionary, or a word that could be "
"easily associated with you, like your middle name. A good password will "
"contain a mixture of letters, numbers and punctuation and will be changed at "
"regular intervals. The root password is changed by running the 'passwd' "
"program as root."
