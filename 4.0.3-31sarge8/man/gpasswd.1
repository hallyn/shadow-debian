administrator(s) and \fB-M\fR option to define members and

Group administrator can add and delete users using \fB-a\fR
and \fB-d\fR options respectively. Administrators can use
\fB-r\fR option to remove group password. When no password 
is set only group members can use

access to the group through
.BR newgrp (1)
command.
.PP
\fBgpasswd\fR called by a group administrator with group name only prompts
