About PAM support in the Shadow Password Suite

Warning: this code is still considered BETA.  It needs more testing.
Please let me know if it works, or if something doesn't work.

Use "./configure --with-libpam" to enable PAM support in the login,
passwd and su applications.

When compiled with PAM support enabled, the following traditional features
of the shadow suite are not implemented directly in the applications -
instead, they should be implemented in the PAM modules.

login:
 - /etc/login.access
 - /etc/porttime
 - resource limits
 - console groups
 - password expiration / password strength checks
 - /etc/motd and mail check

passwd:
 - administrator defined authentication methods
 - TCFS support
 - password expiration
 - password strength checks

su:
 - wheel group
 - console groups
 - su access control (/etc/suauth)
 - password expiration
 - time restrictions
 - resource limits
